# Web-App-project
This project is for the CondorHacks Hackathon.

It follows the theme of Improving Education(online education), it allows the student to input their tasks to a list and as the list is completed the tree will 
grow. This is visually showing the user how all their little completed tasks amount to a big change such as growth in a tree, this creates a bit of a game and satisfying feeling
of accomplishment when they actually finish all the items on their list, such as assignments, studying and others.
